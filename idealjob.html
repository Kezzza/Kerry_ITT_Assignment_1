    <h2>What does a data scientist do?</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);"><br>
    As a data scientist, you’re looking at numbers that have an actual place in the real world, analysing figures that have a tangible presence, affect each other, and affect numbers you didn’t even know you were supposed to look at in the first place. High schoolers always complain about the lack of real world application in maths. Myself included.
<br><br><br>
Part of the job is generating hypotheses for certain trends by reading numbers. You have to know what values to pay attention to, if you want to get the right conclusion. You become part of the brain of your organisation, tell them what’s happening, why they’re succeeding, why they’re failing, what people like and what they dislike. The analysis-heavy aspect alone is extremely attractive to me, and that there is an actual problem-solving component coupled with the reading part makes it even better.

<h2>What does it take to be a data scientist?</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);"><br>
As a data scientist, basic computer literacy is no longer enough. Proficiency in programming with a large variety of languages is required to accomplish your tasks, whether that’s to code something to help you gather your data, or even just understanding the language your database runs with. Additionally, there is a bonus to having a strong foundation in mathematics and the ability to deliver information in a manner that is digestible to an audience that may not necessarily have the same fluency in the topic.
<br><br><br>
Other skills that employers will look for in a data scientist include fluency with cloud computing, the ability to create statistical models, and potentially understanding of the workings behind machine learning.
<br><br><br>
To become a data scientist, you need to first complete an undergraduate course in Information Technology, Mathematics, or Econometrics, before taking on a post-graduate qualification for Data Science.
<br><br><br>
As of now, I can say that I do have a natural affinity with mathematics (enough to pass Specialist Maths without studying, not that that’s something I should be particularly proud of), along with a genuine enjoyment of data analysis, which I discovered in Informatics. I have a notable strength in my ability to present and communicate to large audiences verbally, and I am confident in my experience in visual communication and design, along with the occasional sidebit of infographic/data visualisations.
<br><br><br>
However, my knowledge of programming is limited to the simplest of functions strictly in Visual Basic, and my capabilities with creating databases only goes to the extent that allows me to create a very basic relational database and form. My current understanding of statistical modelling suggests to me that while I have the foundation in mathematics, I may be missing knowledge that I am currently not fully aware of. Needless to say, I am unable to generate the programs required for machine learning, and my knowledge in cloud computing is also minimal at best.
