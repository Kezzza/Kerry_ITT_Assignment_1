  <h1> What's my project idea? </h1>
  <p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);"><canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="2000" style="float:left;"></canvas><canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="2000" style="float:right;"></canvas>
My project is to create an atmosphere generator. This will generally be used for the sake of mental health and relaxation, and will work primarily through stimulation of one’s hearing, and potentially sight and touch. The atmosphere generator will most likely take on a form similar to that of common voice-activated speakers such as the Google Home, or the Echo Dot, and will have similar permissions related to smart home technology, such as access to lights and windows/glass to accomplish its task. Additionally, it will have access to its users vitals, and multiple users will each have their own profile registered. The most attractive point of this product should be its ability to generate atmosphere profiles unique to its user’s needs and preferences, and to negate unpleasant stimuli through noise cancellation or distraction.
<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2> What for? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);">Mental health disorders are extremely common, with some reports stating that up to a third of any population will experience an anxiety disorder at some point of their life. Despite this, the most optimistic statistics demonstrate that only a third of these people will report their symptoms, with the most grave reports stating that only a tenth of people will admit to their sufferings. This doesn’t even include other mental health issues such as depression, or conditions such as autism that can induce similar stress upon an individual.
<br><br><br>
The amount of stigma revolving around mental health has resulted in a population that is afraid of admitting that they are unwell, that they need professional treatment. This product, while not being a form of professional help, aims to soothe the ails of those who recognise their mental health is dipping in quality. By creating a sense of familiarity and thus comfort for its user, and cancelling out sources of agitation in the environment, this product aims to be an anchoring point for those who feel as though the currents of the world are overwhelming them.
<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2> Exactly what would it do? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);">The product will generate ambience and visual stimuli to create an atmosphere for its user. The audio aspect will initially only have a default series of ambient stimuli, a selection of noises and sounds that are commonly appreciated by those who utilise ambient therapy. Potential candidates for these default options include but are not limited to rainfall, ocean sounds, forest sounds and basic white noise. Both speaker and headphones are options for this component.
<br><br><br>
As the product is used, it will introduce slight variations on the sounds, branching from what is commonly selected, along with what can be heard in the room/environment it has been placed in, and identify what kinds of variations create the best results in its users vitals for the sake of relaxation. For example, if a user’s most frequently selected options are rainfall and forest sounds, it will learn to merge the two kinds of sounds to create something akin to a rainforest. If the user selects white noise the most often, it may start leaning into more non-diegetic sound types, such as different sources of white noise, or even music.
<br><br><br>
The user can also choose to introduce their own sound samples, acoustically or digitally, to accelerate the development of their sound profile, or to override the direction it grows in. These variations will be remembered and stored, and it will aim to constantly develop these noises to further the effectiveness of the ambient therapy. This means that not only will it become more effective as it sees more use, but that it will also have a natural variation to the sounds that would not be found in the noise samples that one might find on an online ambient therapy site.
<br><br><br>
To complement the sound whitelist, even when not being used to actively generate an atmosphere, the user can have it switch modes to make entries to a sound blacklist. This mode will listen to the types of sounds that the user experiences in their day-to-day life, and will remember what kinds of noises generate anxiety by recognising patterns and correlations between certain sound profiles and agitation in the user’s vitals. When it develops a profile of blacklisted sound profiles, it will modulate its own ambience by avoiding these types of sounds, and introducing sounds that will negate anxiety-inducing environmental stimuli through frequency/sound wave theory.
<br><br><br>
By remembering and storing these atmospheric profiles that cater to an individuals needs, it develops a sense of familiarity. It also provides a sense of effortless control, in that it detects what the individual’s needs are, while also respecting any foreign customisations that the user actively chooses to introduce. Familiarity and a sense of control in the way this product’s stimuli changes and develops over time are the cornerstones in this product’s ability to complete its task.
<br><br><br>
It will also have a 360 degree projector on it, displaying slow-moving visuals on the walls of the room. This can be activated independently from the sound generating component. This can serve those who are particularly receptive to visual stimuli. Additional modifications to its atmospheric manipulation can be present if it has access to smart home features. By reading the oxygen levels, temperature, and light levels of the room, it can adjust various parts of the home such as lights and windows to augment the immersiveness of the atmosphere it generates, or to bring greater comfort to its user.
<br><br><br>
While this product may initially feel lacklustre and require effort to set up, its ability to learn should result in an experience that continues to improve with every use.
<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2> What would I need to complete this project? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);">
For this product to function, it would require artificial intelligence for its core function, along with a powerful speaker and high quality headphone jack, along with a sensitive microphone. A projector would be required for the visual component, along with the various metric readers for it to detect vitals and room conditions. It would need to have access to some kind of database for it to store its user and sound profiles, along with access to a large bank of sounds to play. Internet access would most likely be required for this product to be remotely practical, considering the vast range of sounds it could potentially need to play.
<br><br><br>
Thorough understanding of the way machine learning and AI works would be fundamental to this speaker’s ability to adapt and cater to individual tastes and preferences. A thorough grasp on the theory behind soundwaves and the way different frequencies interact with each other, for the sake of cancelling out sounds, or to work in tandem with one another, will also be important knowledge to avoid dissonance and careless generation of sounds that could potentially cause greater disturbance in the user. More importantly, I’d have to know how to introduce this knowledge to the AI. Knowing how to connect this device to the internet, and teaching it to recognise different categories of sounds will also be required.
<br><br><br>
While artificial intelligence and machine learning are not particularly foreign concepts nowadays, the complexity of this project will most likely require special efforts beyond a standard Information Technology course. For the soundbank, collaboration with a preexisting one may be a viable option.
<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2> What would this accomplish? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);">
If such a project were to be successful, people who use it would find their overall mental health improving. People could use this to help themselves regain their footing when overwhelmed by their surroundings, reducing symptoms of anxiety disorders and acting as a counter to those who find themselves becoming too neurotic, even if they didn’t feel that they were “suffering enough” to seek professional help.
<br><br><br>
The strength in this as a form of therapy comes from the fact that it does not imply judgement in the way a living, breathing human might have. People who are not yet able to overcome their fears of being judged for seeking help from professionals will find comfort in the balanced neutrality of a machine. This first step in self care may be enough to help users realise that they do deserve help and care from other people as well, and potentially raise the amount of people willing to report their illnesses.
