 I was born in Hong Kong on the 16th of October, 2001, and moved to Melbourne, Australia during the following August. Aside from a couple of holidays spent back in HK, I have never left Melbourne. You’ll find that it’s pretty easy to miss my Asian heritage as long as you don’t look at my face. Of course, I have retained a little of my mother tongue, Cantonese, but it’s definitely nothing to brag about. I also have minimal knowledge of Mandarin, the inferior (kidding!), yet far more prevalent cousin of Cantonese, by virtue of my completion of Chinese in VCE.

If you ever want to get in my good books, try to get familiar with birds. While I am by no means an expert in ornithology, I am very much a bird fan. Double points for crows and magpies, and quadruple for parrots. Did you know that even one of the smallest species of parrot, the budgerigar, is capable of learning over a thousand words? For their relatively small brains, these guys are insanely intelligent, and their social dynamics are fascinating. Fun fact, budgies will find other budgie yawns contagious!

On the flip side, owls are incredibly stupid, in contrary to their reputation as the symbol of wisdom. If you look into their ear, you can actually see the side of their eyeball. I bet their skulls are more eyeball than brain.

You’ll also notice, most likely by reading through this site, unfortunately, that I’m the human incarnate of whatever the antonym to concision is. While this was a fun trait to have back in highschool, where the word count of your essays actually mattered in English, I’m now starting to shed hair over the fact that what I have to respect is no longer a word requirement, but a word LIMIT. Please save me.

Last year, I completed Year 12, to no pride from my family, as I had only brought home a measly 74 ATAR, instead of the spicy, spicy 90+ that they had hoped for. If I could’ve changed my Specialist Maths to Art Studio, I would’ve gone for it. Either way, I passed, and managed to yoink a spot in RMIT doing the Games Design course, where I spent my first ever semester of uni oddly dissatisfied, despite my rather artistic and creative disposition. As a result, I moved to plan B, switched courses, and here I am, doing my first semester of Information Technology.

Sick.

Initially, my engagement with IT was limited to whatever was directly involved with computer games, and even then, it was a shallow interest. To begin with, I had little understanding of what aspects of IT would even be relevant in a computer game. Honestly, I probably only thought I liked it because it was so easy in primary school. At best, I liked the idea of IT, but if 2010 Kerry looked at what I was actually doing now, in an actual IT course, she’d probably throw up.

My curiosity for the topic only truly began back in 2016, when I was made aware of what kind of monstrous entity the entire branch of IT really was. I happened upon an article that provided me a hypothetical sneak peek of a future that had its foundations deeply rooted into IT.

The article spoke of the fantastical utopia that artificial intelligence could bring, and of the horrific dystopia that it could also unleash upon humanity. The contents of the article made me feel ill, yet oddly excited. The realisation that SAI wasn’t even that far from reality was a bomb that blasted my understanding of IT wide open. My curiosity for the topic pushed me to pursue IT for the rest of my highschool career.

Eventually, I realised that, yeah, maybe potentially world-ending entities made of steel and hyperintelligence weren’t my cup of tea, but I’d found that other aspects of IT had roped me in. Programming, probably the first thing to come to mind in most people’s heads when you say IT, was frustrating. At the same time, the real world problem solving aspect of it was humbling and satisfying.

What really convinced me to move to IT when I decided that Game Design was no good, however, was actually my experience with databases in Informatics. While a majority of my memories with exercising on cloud computing, Microsoft Access and crying over singular typos ruining my code are now faded to dust, I’d realised that my appreciation for the topic had yet to leave me.

Come the end of Year 12, I’m panicking because I have to finalise my path for university. Mistaking my enjoyment of art as a hobby for a passion to take it as a career, I head down into Games Design at RMIT, where I spent the next six months going “Okay...neat,” before realising maybe something as passion-driven as Games Design was not for me.

When I was switching courses, I’d found that at the very least, I’d appreciated the overall culture and attitude that the teachers had during my experience so far. Everyone was open-minded and accepting, and even if my lecturers weren’t talking about IT, I felt that the overall attitude they had would translate well to other areas of discussion. I can’t predict for sure that every lecturer in every class would be the same, but so far, so good.

Aside from that expectation, I’m hoping to hear more discussions about the fantastical parts of IT, the things that we think are pushing the limits of human creativity and imagination, yet come tangibly closer to reality each day. Although I currently have no intention to branch my career out in that direction, I’d love to hear what my peers know of, and what the world has come up with so far.

For something a bit more grounded in reality, I’d like to know more about working with data. How to compile and store it, how to read it, how to transform it into digestible information, and communicating that information. So far, I’ve only gotten a brief taste of it in Informatics and I wouldn’t mind a career based on analysing data. Taste acquired!
With that knowledge, I would hope to become a data scientist.

As a data scientist, you’re looking at numbers that have an actual place in the real world, analysing figures that have a tangible presence, affect each other, and affect numbers you didn’t even know you were supposed to look at in the first place. High schoolers always complain about the lack of real world application in maths. Myself included.

As a data scientist, you’re coming up with reasons for certain trends by reading numbers. You have to know what values to pay attention to, if you want to get the right conclusion. You become part of the brain of your organisation, tell them what’s happening, why they’re succeeding, why they’re failing, what people like and what they dislike. The analysis-heavy aspect alone is extremely attractive to me, and that there is an actual problem-solving component coupled with the reading part makes it even better.

As a data scientist, basic computer literacy is no longer enough. Proficiency in programming with a large variety of languages is required to accomplish your tasks, whether that’s to code something to help you gather your data, or even just understanding the language your database runs with. Additionally, there is a bonus to having a strong foundation in mathematics and the ability to deliver information in a manner that is digestible to an audience that may not necessarily have the same fluency in the topic.

Other skills that employers will look for in a data scientist include fluency with cloud computing, the ability to create statistical models, and potentially understanding of the workings behind machine learning.

To become a data scientist, you need to first complete an undergraduate course in Information Technology, Mathematics, or Econometrics, before taking on a post-graduate qualification for Data Science.

As of now, I can say that I do have a natural affinity with mathematics (enough to pass Specialist Maths without studying, not that that’s something I should be particularly proud of), along with a genuine enjoyment of data analysis, which I discovered in Informatics. I have a notable strength in my ability to present and communicate to large audiences verbally, and I am confident in my experience in visual communication and design, along with the occasional sidebit of infographic/data visualisations.

However, my knowledge of programming is limited to the simplest of functions strictly in Visual Basic, and my capabilities with creating databases only goes to the extent that allows me to create a very basic relational database and form. My current understanding of statistical modelling suggests to me that while I have the foundation in mathematics, I may be missing knowledge that I am currently not fully aware of. Needless to say, I am unable to generate the programs required for machine learning, and my knowledge in cloud computing is also minimal at best.

As for my overall personality and attitude in the context of being an employee, various personality tests will reveal certain aspects of me that employers may find attractive.









My learning style relies heavily on visual observation and kinetic interactions. In a group setting, this translates to a difficulty to maintain my engagement if there is no visual stimuli or hands-on experiences, which would require additional effort from whoever is speaking to me.

However, it also means that I will apply my visual tendencies to my means of communication, and provide demonstrations and examples/applications of my contention, resulting in stronger, more vivid presentations when I am communicating to an audience, or to my group members.

I would struggle to come up with the subject on which my presentation would revolve around, but my strengths in communication would make me a valuable speaker when that speed bump is behind me.



My MBTI Test states that I am an INFP, a result that I have consistently received throughout multiple takings of this test in the past half-decade. However, the extent to which I fulfill each trait of the INFP - Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting, do not all necessarily lean particularly heavily to one side.

Perhaps on a different day, I might resemble an alternative personality type altogether, which would not be out of place with my constantly shifting and adapting personality, though one could argue that such flexibility only strengthens my position as a Mediator type.

Mind - 56% Introverted, 44% Extroverted
While I do have a slight preference to socialising with small groups or with a single person at a time, I do not tire easily from larger gatherings, and can enjoy larger companies

Energy - 58% Intuitive, 42% Observant
Although I am generally creative and imaginative, and can appreciate the challenge in digging through layers to form out-of-the-box interpretations, I am also still fairly grounded, and I try not to stray too far from what is before me

Nature - 58% Feeling, 42% Thinking
I am biased towards my heart over my brain, but I do not lose control of my emotions, or let them control me. Rather, I try to provide equal appreciation and consideration to both the emotional and logical aspects of an issue -



Tactics - 79% Prospecting, 21% Judging
My heavier leanings into a Prospecting type are reflected in my multi-tracked mind, and the overall fickleness in my work ethic. That is not to say I am unable to tunnel vision onto a single target; I have moments where I can maintain intense focus and dedication for a single task.

Identity - 93% Turbulent, 7% Assertive
I am often harshly critical of my own efforts, and struggle to take pride in my achievements. This lack of confidence has been a constant point of contention throughout my constant efforts to better myself over the years. On the bright side, it has encouraged me to take on a habit of closer introspection and general reflection, providing me with greater self awareness.

The typical traits associated with an INFP are idealism, passion, creativity, flexibility, and impracticality. A noted weakness is supposedly an inability or aversion to working with data, which I cannot say applies to me at all. I would say that MBTI has accurately captured only a portion of my personality, but does not depict the analytical, detail-oriented side of me that I value just as much as my idealistic, imaginative side.






My results from the IPIP Big Five Personality Traits mostly reflect the results of my MBTI 16 Personalities Test, the one notable conflicting trait being in the Extroversion sector. However, it is worth considering that this test displays the results as percentile rankings out of the results of the full population of partakers, whereas the 16 Personalities results display your leanings towards one side or the other.

As a result, I cannot say for sure whether or not this test has judged me inaccurately in comparison to MBTI, as it is entirely possible that I have scored a higher percentile as a result of more introverts taking this test, or that the human population as a whole is actually more introverted than I expected.

Emotional stability is this test’s version of Identity, and it reflects my MBTI result as a Turbulent type. My agreeableness and intellect/imagination is also reasonably high, which is concordant with the INFP’s flexibility and creativity/idealism. I believe my conscientiousness score percentile is highly accurate here, as I do find it a struggle to find motivation and dedicate myself even to tasks that I recognise to be important, resulting in heavy procrastination.

Overall summary of my results


As an employee, this means that my strength lies in being able to accelerate my team towards our goal. While I may easily lose sight of the big picture and come up with impractical solutions or lack confidence and assertiveness when trying to provide a direction, I will pick up the pace quickly once the team gathers their bearings around the problem that we need to solve.

I am closer to the heart and hands of the team than its brain, as I will not only accelerate our actions, but also bring energy and raise morale. Additionally, my flexibility and creativity can become the glue of my group as I will have a natural tendency to find a suitable compromise for everyone in the case of a conflict. My general tendency to appease to my team also grants me a strength that I would not have in a solo-context, as my desire to maintain harmony to the group overrides my fickle work ethic and tendency to procrastinate.

This means that in a group dynamic, I am at my weakest as a leader or director, though that does not mean I am most effective as a minor pawn; I excel in a position where I have established authority and gained the respect of my group’s members, as that is where my aforementioned traits can shine the brightest, while foregoing the scenarios that expose my lack of assertiveness and impracticality. Overall, contrary to my leanings to introversion, I work more effectively as an individual in a group than alone.

Project Idea


My project is to create an atmosphere generator. This will generally be used for the sake of mental health and relaxation, and will work primarily through stimulation of one’s hearing, and potentially sight and touch. The atmosphere generator will most likely take on a form similar to that of common voice-activated speakers such as the Google Home, or the Echo Dot, and will have similar permissions related to smart home technology, such as access to lights and windows/glass to accomplish its task. Additionally, it will have access to its users vitals, and multiple users will each have their own profile registered. The most attractive point of this product should be its ability to generate atmosphere profiles unique to its user’s needs and preferences, and to negate unpleasant stimuli through noise cancellation or distraction.

Mental health disorders are extremely common, with some reports stating that up to a third of any population will experience an anxiety disorder at some point of their life. Despite this, the most optimistic statistics demonstrate that only a third of these people will report their symptoms, with the most grave reports stating that only a tenth of people will admit to their sufferings. This doesn’t even include other mental health issues such as depression, or conditions such as autism that can induce similar stress upon an individual.

The amount of stigma revolving around mental health has resulted in a population that is afraid of admitting that they are unwell, that they need professional treatment. This product, while not being a form of professional help, aims to soothe the ails of those who recognise their mental health is dipping in quality. By creating a sense of familiarity and thus comfort for its user, and cancelling out sources of agitation in the environment, this product aims to be an anchoring point for those who feel as though the currents of the world are overwhelming them.

The product will generate ambience and visual stimuli to create an atmosphere for its user. The audio aspect will initially only have a default series of ambient stimuli, a selection of noises and sounds that are commonly appreciated by those who utilise ambient therapy. Potential candidates for these default options include but are not limited to rainfall, ocean sounds, forest sounds and basic white noise. Both speaker and headphones are options for this component.

As the product is used, it will introduce slight variations on the sounds, branching from what is commonly selected, along with what can be heard in the room/environment it has been placed in, and identify what kinds of variations create the best results in its users vitals for the sake of relaxation. For example, if a user’s most frequently selected options are rainfall and forest sounds, it will learn to merge the two kinds of sounds to create something akin to a rainforest. If the user selects white noise the most often, it may start leaning into more non-diegetic sound types, such as different sources of white noise, or even music.

The user can also choose to introduce their own sound samples, acoustically or digitally, to accelerate the development of their sound profile, or to override the direction it grows in. These variations will be remembered and stored, and it will aim to constantly develop these noises to further the effectiveness of the ambient therapy. This means that not only will it become more effective as it sees more use, but that it will also have a natural variation to the sounds that would not be found in the noise samples that one might find on an online ambient therapy site.

To complement the sound whitelist, even when not being used to actively generate an atmosphere, the user can have it switch modes to make entries to a sound blacklist. This mode will listen to the types of sounds that the user experiences in their day-to-day life, and will remember what kinds of noises generate anxiety by recognising patterns and correlations between certain sound profiles and agitation in the user’s vitals. When it develops a profile of blacklisted sound profiles, it will modulate its own ambience by avoiding these types of sounds, and introducing sounds that will negate anxiety-inducing environmental stimuli through frequency/sound wave theory.

By remembering and storing these atmospheric profiles that cater to an individuals needs, it develops a sense of familiarity. It also provides a sense of effortless control, in that it detects what the individual’s needs are, while also respecting any foreign customisations that the user actively chooses to introduce. Familiarity and a sense of control in the way this product’s stimuli changes and develops over time are the cornerstones in this product’s ability to complete its task.

It will also have a 360 degree projector on it, displaying slow-moving visuals on the walls of the room. This can be activated independently from the sound generating component. This can serve those who are particularly receptive to visual stimuli. Additional modifications to its atmospheric manipulation can be present if it has access to smart home features. By reading the oxygen levels, temperature, and light levels of the room, it can adjust various parts of the home such as lights and windows to augment the immersiveness of the atmosphere it generates, or to bring greater comfort to its user.

While this product may initially feel lacklustre and require effort to set up, its ability to learn should result in an experience that continues to improve with every use.

For this product to function, it would require artificial intelligence for its core function, along with a powerful speaker and high quality headphone jack, along with a sensitive microphone. A projector would be required for the visual component, along with the various metric readers for it to detect vitals and room conditions. It would need to have access to some kind of database for it to store its user and sound profiles, along with access to a large bank of sounds to play. Internet access would most likely be required for this product to be remotely practical, considering the vast range of sounds it could potentially need to play.

Thorough understanding of the way machine learning and AI works would be fundamental to this speaker’s ability to adapt and cater to individual tastes and preferences. A thorough grasp on the theory behind soundwaves and the way different frequencies interact with each other, for the sake of cancelling out sounds, or to work in tandem with one another, will also be important knowledge to avoid dissonance and careless generation of sounds that could potentially cause greater disturbance in the user. More importantly, I’d have to know how to introduce this knowledge to the AI. Knowing how to connect this device to the internet, and teaching it to recognise different categories of sounds will also be required.

While artificial intelligence and machine learning are not particularly foreign concepts nowadays, the complexity of this project will most likely require special efforts beyond a standard Information Technology course. For the soundbank, collaboration with a preexisting one may be a viable option.

If such a project were to be successful, people who use it would find their overall mental health improving. People could use this to help themselves regain their footing when overwhelmed by their surroundings, reducing symptoms of anxiety disorders and acting as a counter to those who find themselves becoming too neurotic, even if they didn’t feel that they were “suffering enough” to seek professional help.

The strength in this as a form of therapy comes from the fact that it does not imply judgement in the way a living, breathing human might have. People who are not yet able to overcome their fears of being judged for seeking help from professionals will find comfort in the balanced neutrality of a machine. This first step in self care may be enough to help users realise that they do deserve help and care from other people as well, and potentially raise the amount of people willing to report their illnesses.
