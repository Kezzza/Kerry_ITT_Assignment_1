  Hello, my name is Kerry Tsz Man Lam. If you want to be quirky, you can use my Chinese name, 林枝蔓. If you want to be REALLY quirky about the unique identifier that you choose to refer to me by, you can use my student code, S3839262.

 I was born in Hong Kong on the 16th of October, 2001, and moved to Melbourne, Australia during the following August. Aside from a couple of holidays spent back in HK, I have never left Melbourne. You’ll find that it’s pretty easy to miss my Asian heritage as long as you don’t look at my face. Of course, I have retained a little of my mother tongue, Cantonese, but it’s definitely nothing to brag about. I also have minimal knowledge of Mandarin, the inferior (kidding!), yet far more prevalent cousin of Cantonese, by virtue of my completion of Chinese in VCE.

If you ever want to get in my good books, try to get familiar with birds. While I am by no means an expert in ornithology, I am very much a bird fan. Double points for crows and magpies, and quadruple for parrots. Did you know that even one of the smallest species of parrot, the budgerigar, is capable of learning over a thousand words? For their relatively small brains, these guys are insanely intelligent, and their social dynamics are fascinating. Fun fact, budgies will find other budgie yawns contagious!

On the flip side, owls are incredibly stupid, in contrary to their reputation as the symbol of wisdom. If you look into their ear, you can actually see the side of their eyeball. I bet their skulls are more eyeball than brain.

You’ll also notice, most likely by reading through this site, unfortunately, that I’m the human incarnate of whatever the antonym to concision is. While this was a fun trait to have back in highschool, where the word count of your essays actually mattered in English, I’m now starting to shed hair over the fact that what I have to respect is no longer a word requirement, but a word LIMIT. Please save me.

Last year, I completed Year 12, to no pride from my family, as I had only brought home a measly 74 ATAR, instead of the spicy, spicy 90+ that they had hoped for. If I could’ve changed my Specialist Maths to Art Studio, I would’ve gone for it. Either way, I passed, and managed to yoink a spot in RMIT doing the Games Design course, where I spent my first ever semester of uni oddly dissatisfied, despite my rather artistic and creative disposition. As a result, I moved to plan B, switched courses, and here I am, doing my first semester of Information Technology.
