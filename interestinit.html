  <h1 style="background-color:rgb(208, 217, 232); font-family:arial"> My Interest in IT </h1>

<h2 style="font-family:arial"> How did it start? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);font-family:arial"><br>
    Initially, my engagement with IT was limited to whatever was directly involved with computer games, and even then, it was a shallow interest. To begin with, I had little understanding of what aspects of IT would even be relevant in a computer game. Honestly, I probably only thought I liked it because it was so easy in primary school. At best, I liked the idea of IT, but if 2010 Kerry looked at what I was actually doing now, in an actual IT course, she’d probably throw up.
<br><br><br>
My curiosity for the topic only truly began back in 2016, when I was made aware of what kind of monstrous entity the entire branch of IT really was. I happened upon an article that provided me a hypothetical sneak peek of a future that had its foundations deeply rooted into IT.
<br><br><br>
The article spoke of the fantastical utopia that artificial intelligence could bring, and of the horrific dystopia that it could also unleash upon humanity. The contents of the article made me feel ill, yet oddly excited. The realisation that SAI wasn’t even that far from reality was a bomb that blasted my understanding of IT wide open. My curiosity for the topic pushed me to pursue IT for the rest of my highschool career.
<br><br><br>
Eventually, I realised that, yeah, maybe potentially world-ending entities made of steel and hyperintelligence weren’t my cup of tea, but I’d found that other aspects of IT had roped me in. Programming, probably the first thing to come to mind in most people’s heads when you say IT, was frustrating. At the same time, the real world problem solving aspect of it was humbling and satisfying.
<br><br><br>
What really convinced me to move to IT when I decided that Game Design was no good, however, was actually my experience with databases in Informatics. While a majority of my memories with exercising on cloud computing, Microsoft Access and crying over singular typos ruining my code are now faded to dust, I’d realised that my appreciation for the topic had yet to leave me.
<br><br><br>
Come the end of Year 12, I’m panicking because I have to finalise my path for university. Mistaking my enjoyment of art as a hobby for a passion to take it as a career, I head down into Games Design at RMIT, where I spent the next six months going “Okay...neat,” before realising maybe something as passion-driven as Games Design was not for me.
<br><br><br>
When I was switching courses, I’d found that at the very least, I’d appreciated the overall culture and attitude that the teachers had during my experience so far. Everyone was open-minded and accepting, and even if my lecturers weren’t talking about IT, I felt that the overall attitude they had would translate well to other areas of discussion. I can’t predict for sure that every lecturer in every class would be the same, but so far, so good.
<br><br><br>
<h2 style="font-family:arial"> What else am I hoping to learn about now? </h2>
<p style="color:rgb(45,56,77);font-family:arial"><br>
Aside from that expectation, I’m hoping to hear more discussions about the fantastical parts of IT, the things that we think are pushing the limits of human creativity and imagination, yet come tangibly closer to reality each day. Although I currently have no intention to branch my career out in that direction, I’d love to hear what my peers know of, and what the world has come up with so far.
<br><br><br>
For something a bit more grounded in reality, I’d like to know more about working with data. How to compile and store it, how to read it, how to transform it into digestible information, and communicating that information. So far, I’ve only gotten a brief taste of it in Informatics and I wouldn’t mind a career based on analysing data. Taste acquired!
